My upbringing was influenced by a collective of individuals who possessed a 
strong affinity for information technology. Consequently, I developed into an 
individual characterised by unwavering determination and adeptness in technological 
matters, harbouring a profound affection for this domain. The commencement of my 
scholarly journey transpired subsequent to my completion of secondary education, 
wherein I expeditiously discerned the inadequacies inherent in the conventional 
academic trajectory. In order to have a comprehensive understanding of the 
broader scope, I made the decision to relocate to Germany with the intention of 
pursuing a further education in the field of Mechatronics & Business. This 
interdisciplinary programme amalgamates technical intricacies with strategic 
business principles.As a current student, my employment experience is limited. 
However, during my stay in Brazil, I actively participated in various programming 
marathons and hackathons due to my profound interest in the subject. Engaging in 
these activities facilitated the enhancement of my proficiency in C++, mechanics, 
and thermodynamics, while simultaneously igniting my ambition to establish a 
technology firm in the future. In conjunction with my technical proficiency, I 
have also cultivated essential managerial and leadership competencies, collectively 
demonstrating my dedication to adopting a holistic perspective while addressing matters.
